# Haystack

Haystack is an end-to-end framework for Question Answering & Neural search that enables you to..  
... **ask questions** in natural language and find granular answers in your own documents.  
... do **semantic document search** and retrieve more relevant documents for your search queries.  
... **search at scale** through millions of documents.  
... use off-the-shelf models or **fine-tune** them to your own domain.  
... **evaluate, benchmark** and continuously improve your models via user feedback.  
... **improve chat bots** by leveraging existing knowledge bases for the long tail of queries.  
... **automate processes** by automatically applying a list of questions to new documents and using the extracted answers.
